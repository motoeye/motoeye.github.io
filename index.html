  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <p>Robots have been in use in the industry since the early 20th century when the first
    humanoid robot was developed. Modern robots were developed sometime later, initially used
    in factories as industrial robots. But the field of robotics has come a long way since then,
    producing digitally programmed and AI-powered robots. These modern robots are used in
    many cutting-edge fields apart from manufacturing, like surgeries, transportation, and even
    space exploration. Robots have moved from the role of replacing humans in repetitive and
    monotonous tasks, to an assisting role, where they work alongside humans. Though great
    advancements in robotics and AI have been made in the past decade to make them ‘smart’,
    not much emphasis has been given to making these robots safe, or in other words,
    collaborative.</p>
    <p>
    According to ISO/TS 15066, a collaborative robot is a robot that is capable of being
    used in a collaborative space. A collaborative space is defined as a space within the operating
    space (including the workpiece), where the robot system and a human can perform tasks
    concurrently during the product operation. Most of the modern robots used in the industry
    can be digitally controlled and many of them are powered by AI, but most of them lack the
    required safety features that allow them to be fully collaborative. Some companies do make
    collaborative robots, but most of them are too expensive to buy, and can only be configured
    for smaller payloads (up to 5kgs in most cases), making them infeasible for regular industrial
    operation.
    </p>
    <p>
    The main goal of this project is to design a cheap and universal collaborative robotics
    solution, which can easily be integrated with existing industrial robotic manipulators in use,
    and can make them collaborative, or in other words, safe enough for humans to work
    alongside them. The proposed solution will use Computer Vision for object detection, using
    Depth and vision information from Intel Realsense Depth cameras. Collision meshes will be
    created after obtaining this information, and instructions will be sent to the robot manipulator
    to avoid collision without affecting its performance. A Jetson TX1 development board has
    been chosen for implementing this project since it has the required processing power needed
    to run computer vision algorithm and can run ROS (Robot operating system) on a customized
    Linux OS, which has most of the computer vision and dynamic path modeling libraries
    needed for collision avoidance. It also has enough power to receive feed from multiple
    Realsense depth cameras and has built-in libraries to communicate with a FANUC robot
    controller chosen for this project.
